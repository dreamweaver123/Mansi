<p>When I asked Alexis, Director of Meridien’s Urban Museum, to give me her personal tour of the city she’s resided in since her teenage years, she accepted, but only if we did it by bicycle. I’m not a fitness freak and Meridien is known for its formidable hills, so when 6am rolled around, damp streets outside my apartment window, and my cell phone started buzzing, I was hoping it was Alexis calling to tell me that we were switching to plan B.
“Sorry, Charlie. We’re not going to let a little misty air ruin our fun. Anyway, the forecast says it will clear up by late morning.” So much for Plan B.</p>

<p>We met at the Smith Street subway station, a mid-century, mildly brutalist concrete cube designed by architects in 1962 that is in the process of a full greening renovation. 
“I love this building. It’s a modern masterpiece—poetic instead of cold and offputting. The city could have torn it down and put up a more contemporary structure, but they recognized its historical importance and instead are just working to make it more environmentally friendly and energy efficient through our Off-Grid program.”</p>

<p> We were here not to tour the subway station, though, but to pick up our transportation for the long ride ahead. And, no, we’re not taking the tube. (“It’s not going to be that hard a ride,” Alexis emailed me earlier in the week, “Meridien’s flatter than you think. Especially if you know the secret routes.”) Meridien has its own bike-sharing program—called HUB—that has become increasingly popular with the locals, especially now with hundreds of bike drop-off/pickup stations scattered across the city. One swipe of your credit or debit card and you’re off to the races. Amazingly, the program has reduced traffic in the city center almost 50%, even in the chilly winter. </p>

<p>We grab our bikes and zoom across the street to the bike lane that skirts the northern edge of the park. Part of the bike-sharing program’s popularity is that Meridien has invested heavily in creating dedicated cycling paths to accompany the thousands of new bikes on the streets. We rush past the pastiche of architectural styles and eras that characterize Meridien’s eclectic urbanism, something Alexis has made a career of celebrating. “A real city is never homogenous,” she remarks.</p>

<p>Our first stop is Friar’s Market—an open-air agora for Meridien’s local farmers and produce growers to sell their fresh organic sustenance to residents weary of the old supermarket model. The long arcade is teeming with a kaleidoscope of nature’s best colors—fruits, vegetables, and fauna sit comfortably in the bins meticulously arranged by each of their growers. “The best part of the experience here is that I get to converse with the people who actually grew this stuff,” beams Alexis. “ Nothing against the nice folks that work at  the supermarket, but Friar’s Market vendors have such an intimacy with what they sell here. It’s their lifeblood, their means of survival.” </p>

<p>How could I argue? The green apple I bought and consumed on the spot was so scrumptious it almost made me want to grow my own tree de pomme on my building’s roof.
We cut up Grayson Boulevard towards the “Green Light” district, Meridien’s center of provincial haute couture and cuisine, where rustic cafes huddle alongside to boutiques offering hemp clothing and hipster hubs that sell art, books, and the latest designer accessory. After a whirlwind browse through almost ten different retailers, we greet the setting sun by settling at Alexis’s favorite evening hangout spot, Le Bon Mot. </p>

<p>"I’ll always be pushing for Meridien to move forward—to promote thoughtful development by utilizing our best and brightest creative minds, whether they be artists, architects, or chefs. But I’ll be honest—" Alexis eases back into her chaise lounge and smiles, "there’s nothing like the vibe of an old French bistro, even if we’re not in France."</p>
